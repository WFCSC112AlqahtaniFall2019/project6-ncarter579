After getting the data from the program and plotting it, it became obvious that while the vector InsertSort and the linked list InsertSort have similar times for lists up to 2000 items long, past that the linked list InsertionSort method is objectivly faster. This is because with the linked list method once you find the value you need to swap you only need to rearange the pointers of the diffrent nodes and then your list is complete again. This differs from the vector approach where you need to shift all the elements in the vector over whenever you want to insert or delete an item. The time it takes to shift all these elements explains the increased length of time it takes the vector version to finsih sorting the list.
